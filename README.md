# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using a machine learning approach. By leveraging a dataset of 13,000 property listings, we employ data preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced modeling techniques to provide accurate price estimates. The goal is to assist potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Project Objectives

- **Accurate Price Predictions**: Develop a model that accurately predicts the price of a house based on various features.
- **Data Insights**: Gain insights into the factors influencing house prices in Bengaluru, such as location, size, and amenities.
- **Model Robustness**: Ensure the model is robust and reliable through thorough validation and testing.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values and inconsistent data entries to ensure high data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that capture essential aspects of the data, such as the number of bedrooms (BHK) and price per square foot.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplify the dataset by reducing the number of unique locations, grouping less frequent locations under a common category.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identify and remove outliers to improve model performance and reliability.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical location data into numerical format to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Building**: Experiment with various regression models to find the best fit for the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters and achieve the best possible accuracy.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement K-Fold cross-validation to validate model performance and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

## Benefits

- **For Buyers**: Get a fair estimate of house prices based on desired features and location, helping to make informed purchasing decisions.
- **For Sellers**: Understand the market value of properties to price them competitively.
- **For Real Estate Professionals**: Provide clients with accurate property valuations and market insights.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in real estate price prediction. By carefully preprocessing the data, engineering relevant features, and selecting robust models, we aim to provide a valuable tool for anyone involved in the Bengaluru real estate market. Whether you are a buyer, seller, or real estate professional, this project can help you make more informed decisions.
